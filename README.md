# Urban-vitality-index
The goal is to construct an urban vitality index to measure the urban vitality in cities' neighborhoods.

Note: since GitHub repositories do not support the display of interactive maps it is suggested to copy the path of the current repository and past it on nbviewer to see all the plots available.

The current analysis is focused on the city of Trento, but with the necessary implementations it is also possible to adapt the code to other dataset and thus compute similar analysis on different cities.
